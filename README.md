# Notifications Release
This release deploys the [notification service](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/notifications) as an application onto the CloudFoundry platform.
A running CF is required to deploy.
The application will be deployed into the `system` org, and the `notifications-service` space.
The service registers itself at the address matching http://notifications.$CF_APP_DOMAIN.

# Prerequisites
1. Running UAA. This requirement is typically satisfied by having [CloudFoundry](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/cf-release) deployed.
1. Running MySQL instance. One option is to deploy the [CloudFoundry MySQL release](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/cf-mysql-release).

# UAA Client
Notifications requires a UAA client to boot. The client can be created with the following properties:
```yaml
scope: uaa.none
client_id: notifications
authorized_grant_types: client_credentials
authorities: scim.read,cloud_controller.admin
```

# Bosh-lite

## Tips
- Use the latest [notifications final release](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/notifications-release/releases) available, it generally contains bug-fixes.
- Do not cut a release yourself unless you are very familiar wth bosh.

        pass: my-password
        auth_mechanism: plain
  ```

2. Add DB properties to `./bosh-lite/notifications-db-stub.yml` file for your running
   MySQL instance as follows:
